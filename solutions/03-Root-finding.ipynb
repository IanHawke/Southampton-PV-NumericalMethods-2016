The default solver for one dimensional problems in [`brentq`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.brentq.html#scipy.optimize.brentq) which is safe (like bisection) and converges rapidly (although not quite as fast as Newton's method). For multi-dimensional problems the [`root`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html#scipy.optimize.root) function is the standard. All these methods can be accelerated by providing the Jacobian. All are strongly dependent on the initial guess, or interval."
