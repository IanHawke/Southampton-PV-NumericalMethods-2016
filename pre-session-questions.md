# Pre session questions

The technical content (and general motivation) is borrowed from the [Software Carpentry pre-Assessment questionnaire](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/assess/pre-learner.html). Most of the early questions from that aren't needed as this training is for the PV CDT, so the information will be known.

## Setup questions

* What operating system will you use on the laptop you bring to the training?
  - Windows 7 or earlier
  - Windows 8
  - Windows 10
  - Mac OSX 10.8 or earlier
  - Mac OSX 10.9 or 10.10
  - Mac OSX 10.11
  - Linux
  - Other (please specify)
* With which programming languages could you write a program from scratch that reads a column of numbers from a text file and calculates the mean and standard deviation of that data?
  - I do not use any programming language
  - C
  - C++
  - Fortran
  - MATLAB
  - Python
  - Java
  - Perl
  - R
  - Other(s)
* What best describes how often you program?
  - I have never programmed
  - I program less than once a year
  - I program once a year
  - I program several times a year
  - I program once a month
  - I program once a week or more
* What best describes the complexity of your programming? (Choose all that apply.)
  - I have never programmed.
  - I write scripts that are a few lines long to analyze data.
  - I write programs that are a page or two long for my own use.
  - I write programs that are many pages long for my own use and for others to use.
  - I am primarily a programmer.

## Numerical Methods questions

In each of the following scenarios, please select the answer that best applies to you.

* Given a matrix A, write a script that would calculate its determinant and inverse. Given a suitable vector b, write a script that would solve the linear system A x = b.
  - I do not know what this means.
  - I understand the task but could not complete it.
  - I could complete the task with help from documentation and search engines.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help, using Python.
* Given a function f of a single variable x, write a script that would find a root of the function - a point s such that f(x) = 0.
  - I do not know what this means.
  - I understand the task but could not complete it.
  - I could complete the task with help from documentation and search engines.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help, using Python.
* Given a function f of a single variable x, write a script that computes the definite integral of f using Monte Carlo integration.
  - I do not know what this means.
  - I understand the task but could not complete it.
  - I could complete the task with help from documentation and search engines.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help, using Python.
* Given an initial value problem y' = f(x, y), with initial condition y(0) = z, write a script that finds the solution y(x) for x between 0 and 1.
  - I do not know what this means.
  - I understand the task but could not complete it.
  - I could complete the task with help from documentation and search engines.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help.
  - I could complete the task with little or no outside help, using Python.
